# Factom Network Control Panel

A standalone webapp that interfaces with the Factomd API in order to create, manage, and send authority set messages.

## Running

Compiled the `run` subfolder via `go build` or `go install`.

Run with: `./run` 

Available flags:
* `-f`: Set the factomd API endpoint. Default is the MainNet Open API. For a local network, use `localhost:8088`.

## Compatibility

The control panel will work for all Factom networks, however the messages generated by the control panel are not compatible with the MainNet / TestNet. Only nodes compiled from the [WhoSoup/whosoup-multisig_promotion](https://github.com/WhoSoup/factomd/tree/whosoup-multisig_promotion) branch will accept the message.
